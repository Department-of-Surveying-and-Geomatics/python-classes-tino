# Task2: Creating Python Classes 

Create a Python class to represent a simple point class as covered in the [OOP Lecture](https://github.com/Department-of-Surveying-and-Geomatics/Programming-for-Geomatics-Applications/tree/main/oop)

_Write a driver program to:_ 
- Import X and Y coordinates from a text file
- Plot the coordinates on a scatterplot
- Move (translate) the points
- Replot them in a different colour

üê§ _Make sure to write neat documentation and comment on your code where necessary to ensure re-usability_ 

üôÑ You have been provided with two initial starting points in the provided files [task1_class.py](task2_class.py) and [task1_class_action.py](task2_class_action.py). The use of these starting files **IS NOT** mandatory for this exercise.
